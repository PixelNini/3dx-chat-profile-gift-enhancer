This extension is designed to work exclusively on the [3DX Chat Profile Editor](https://status.3dxchat.net/profile-editor) page and is not active on any other sites. It will not interact with or affect any other web pages.

Below are instructions for installing the extension in Chrome and Firefox.

## What Does This Extension Do?

The 3DX Chat Profile Gift Enhancer extension adds a byte-counter to the bottom-left corner of the [3DX Chat Profile Editor](https://status.3dxchat.net/profile-editor) page, along with a convenient color management feature for enhanced user experience.

### Key Features:

-   **Byte Counter**: The existing character count often does not provide an accurate reflection when creating gifts, especially when using custom fonts or symbols that can be larger than a single byte. The extension’s byte-counter ensures that your gift content will fit within the 255-byte limit imposed by 3DX Chat.
-   **Color Management**: Users can easily save their preferred colors while using the profile editor. The extension allows users to select colors using the color picker and save them for later use. Saved colors are displayed in a dedicated section titled "Saved Colors", making it effortless to access and use them as needed. Each saved color text is clickable, allowing quick selection, and users can remove colors from their saved list as required.
